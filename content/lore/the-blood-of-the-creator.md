## Discovery

Lucian found cryptic mentions of this theory in the restricted archives of the **Order of the Gauntlet**. It posits that a **Dhampir** can cleanse their blood of the vampiric curse by slaying the one who turned them and consuming their essence in a specific ritual.

## The Ritual

The texts are intentionally vague, likely to discourage such a dark act. However, three components are consistently mentioned:

1.  **The Heart of the Progenitor**: Must be taken while the vampire is in a state of true death.
2.  **A Vessel of Pure Silver**: Luthcheq-forged silver is recommended for its anti-magical properties.
3.  **A Prayer to Assuran**: Justice must be sought as a form of Retribution.

## Lucian's Obsession

For Lucian, this is more than a legend—it is his only hope of returning to a life where he doesn't hunger for the living. He hunts **[[npcs/lady-isovold|Lady Isovold]]** not just for revenge, but for the "cure" he believes she carries in her veins.
