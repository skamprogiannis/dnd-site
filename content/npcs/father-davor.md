## Description

Father Davor is a priest of **[Ilmater](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ilmater)**, the Broken God, presiding over a crumbling chapel in the slums of **Westgate**. He is a weathered, solemn man, his hands roughened by years of tending to the sick and the poor. He believes that suffering is not a punishment, but a test of the soul's capacity to endure.

## Relationship with Lucian

Davor is the only person who knows **Lucian's** true nature and allows him to live. While the Order of the Gauntlet would execute Lucian as a monster, Davor sees Lucian's "half-life" as a form of **sacred endurance**.

He provides Lucian with:

- **Sanctuary:** A place to rest during the day where the "Static" of [[npcs/lady-isovold|Lady Isovold]] is dampened by holy wards.
- **Counsel:** He reminds Lucian that while his blood may be cursed, he still has a role to play in this life.
- **Supplies:** Holy water and information gathered from the downtrodden of the city.

Davor does not offer pity. He offers spiritual steel, helping Lucian build the mental walls necessary to cage the beast within.
